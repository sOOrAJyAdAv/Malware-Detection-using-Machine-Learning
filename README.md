# Malware-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
AIM:- To predict whether a file has malicious or not , Aim is to train model using Microsoft dataset to reduce the error of finding malicious software.

Dataset:- There are 2 types of file for each software, Byte and ASM.

Steps involved while training model:-
1. Preprocess data and Featurize it so that it can be feeded to Algoritms, for featurization Uni-gram Word2Vec is choosen.
2. Did some Exploratory data analysis on data using T-SNE, found uni-grams are good enough for features.
3. Feeded to different ML Algorithms, and got Log-loss (Evaluation Metric) for each of them.
4. Selected top 2 , which are Random Forest and XgBoost.
5. Applied Random Search (Hyperparameter tuning) on each of them and got error rate 0.038.

The flow chart of how the Feature Engineering is done and how different algorithms is applied on the final merge featurized file of ASM and Byte.

After Applying different machine learning algorithms , the best 2 are Random Forest (Bagging) and XgBoost (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) . These are the Results of the different models, the best is with XGBoost.
